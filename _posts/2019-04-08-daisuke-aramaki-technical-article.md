Hello folks. Work and travel kept me super occupied for quite sometime. I did post somethings about how political correctness and woke culture has resulted in the rise of extremeties at both ends of the spectrum and why I believe it is primarily due to the stupidity of the left. I would like to stick to only technology and work related stuff here at github. I will start posting regularly about the things that I use/develop in my work that may be of interest to others. There have been a few times, where I was quite annoyed with people throwing buzzwords without understanding jack shit about what they are talking about. If you work with data, I am sure you would clearly understand what those words might be. Anyway, watch out this blog space for more tomorrow.
