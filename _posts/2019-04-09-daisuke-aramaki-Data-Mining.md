As promised, I would like to do a series on Data Mining and Analysis based on my experience working with large sets of data for more than a decade now. After all these years, I can tell you this - Exercise great care when dealing with data and be extra careful with your interpretations. If you do exactly as mentioned, you can sleep easy. If you are out for the holy grail everytime you look at a large dataset, you will be utterly disappointed and even worse, your expectation to find that golden egg will skew your methodology and you would finally end up with absolutely wrong information. Trust me, I started out exactly like that. A couple of failures ensured that I had my feet on the ground eversince.
