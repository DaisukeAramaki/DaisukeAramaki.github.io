As promised, I would like to do a series on Data Mining and Analysis based on my experience working with large sets of data for more than a decade now. After all these years, I can tell you this - Exercise great care when dealing with data and be extra careful with your interpretations. If you do exactly as mentioned, you can sleep easy. If you are out for the holy grail everytime you look at a large dataset, you will be utterly disappointed and even worse, your expectation to find that golden egg will skew your methodology and you would finally end up with absolutely wrong information. Trust me, I started out exactly like that. A couple of failures ensured that I had my feet on the ground eversince.

A few junior researchers and consultants at work requested me to write about this. You see, when I started out with data mining, biology had just about become a data rich discipline. This was expected due to the immense success of the human genome project. Whole genome chips became accessible easily and there was a race going on between developed nations in exploiting these rapid developments. I found myself smack in the middle of one such ambitious project in the EU. Exciting times, really. Great leaps in experimental advances oftentimes result in an overhaul and evolution of new mathematical constructs to make sense of a large volume of data. Suddenly, there was an exchange of ideas coming from image processing, pattern recognition, machine learning and other complex statistical methodologies that resulted in the development of novel algorithms and toolkits to study data and drive interpretation. New disciplines were born that took advantage of such a crosstalk between various areas and the status quo has remained eversince, which is a good thing.
