I have started playing around a bit with this setup and hopefully I'll be able to tune the site to meet my expectations in a week or so. Please keep watching. While you are here, please check out my other blog - [A Physicist's Wastebasket](https://theoretischephysiker.wordpress.com). I talk about my other interests, physics and other day to day happenings there. I will use this place for my professional contributions and talk exclusively about technology related matters.
