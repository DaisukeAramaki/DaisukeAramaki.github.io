I have started playing around a bit with this setup and hopefully I'll be able to tune the site to meet my expectations in a week or so. Please keep watching. While you are here, please check out my other blog - [My Wastebasket](https://oldmanaramaki.wordpress.com). I talk about some mundane day to day happenings there. I will use this place for my professional contributions and talk exclusively about technology  and science related matters. My older blog is still online and used to be quite popular. Follow the link for more - [Skinwalker](https://skinwalker.wordpress.com).
