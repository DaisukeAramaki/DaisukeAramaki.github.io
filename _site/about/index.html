			<p style='text-align: justify;'> The grumpy old dog from Section 9 has been one of my favorite characters of all time and my most used online moniker. As a result, a lot of folks on various tech sites, blogs and forums know me as Daisuke Aramaki for more than a decade and a half now. I am in the process of resurrecting my online life after a long absence and decided to use this 9 year old account for my site pages.</p>
			<p style='text-align: justify;'> My real name is Prem and I'm a Theoretical Physicist plus Chemical Engineer from Chennai, India. Quantitative research/consulting is my strong suit and I have been fortunate enough to have deeply explored this area across diverse domains in my career thus far. I lived and worked in EU for more than 14 years as a Research Manager and Management Consultant specializing in Analytics before coming back to Chennai. At the moment, I'm working remotely for a specialized European fintech firm.</p>
			<p style='text-align: justify;'> I'm also available for hire as a freelance researcher, analytics consultant and advisor. Do contact me at my email if you're interested in working with me. In addition to English, I also speak good Japanese, Dutch and fluent German. Feel free to communicate in any of the aforementioned languages. Check out my CV page for some specifics. Also see my other blog for more information.</p>
