  <h1>Career Diversity - Boon or Bane?</h1>

<p>I can relate to this personally. You see, I have worked in many roles across various domains in my career. Although, I was addressing similar questions in tackling problems in different industries. Furthermore, as I had mentioned in my previous blog post, most problems were mathematically analogous. So, it was not that difficult to adapt and after a while I started to see a strong concurrence in such problems. This convergence was more pronounced during the time I was a management consultant. My boss thought that I could address multi-industry issues simultaneously due to my diverse domain experience. While stressful, it actually worked out fine. Every client I worked with during that time was very happy with my contribution and a few of us even became great friends. Our bosses really liked what a couple of us were doing and decided to create an independent cross-functional, cross-industry model development and analysis subsidiary to kick the whole thing up a notch. This will always remain as one of my biggest career accomplishments. Then, as you are preparing yourself to take your career to the next level, your world comes crashing down due to a personal tragedy. I had to come back to India immediately. Although difficult to understand it then, I am absolutely at peace now with how things changed so suddenly. Also, I am very happy and proud the way the organization we influenced creating, has grown leaps and bounds in the last couple of years. They are doing some exceptional work across multiple industrial domains and have won a few prestigious consulting awards.</p>

<p>All those things gave me the impression that a diverse career growth would be a huge asset when looking for a job here in India. Unfortunately, I am starting to think otherwise now.</p>
