		<div class="about">
			<h1>About</h1>
			<p style='text-align: justify;'> Sorry to disappoint if you expected to see the real old man from Section 9. A lot of folks on various tech sites, blogs and forums know me as Daisuke Aramaki/Skinwalker for nearly a decade and for the sake of familiarity, I decided to use the same account for this site. My real name is Prem and I'm from Chennai, India. I'm a Theoretical Physicist plus Chemical Engineer. Weird combination yes, but physics and math rule! Mathematical modeling & Simulation is one of my major areas of expertise and I lived and worked in EU for more than 14 years as a Research Manager and Management Consultant before coming back to Chennai. At the moment, I'm working remotely for a specialized European fintech firm. I'm also available for hire as a freelance researcher, analytics consultant and advisor. Do contact me at my email if you're interested in working with me. In addition to English, I also speak good <strong>Japanese</strong>, Dutch, Italian and fluent <strong>German</strong>. Feel free to communicate in any of the aforementioned languages. Check out my CV page for some specifics. Also check out my other blogs for more information.</p>
