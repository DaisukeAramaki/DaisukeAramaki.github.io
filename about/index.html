			<p style='text-align: justify;'> Sorry to disappoint if you expected to see the chief of Section 9. The grumpy old man has always been one of my favorite characters and decided to use this moniker when I opened this github account 9 years ago. Since a lot of folks on various tech sites, blogs and forums know me as Daisuke Aramaki/Skinwalker for more than a decade and a half now, I am using the same account for my pages as well.</p>
			<p style='text-align: justify;'> My real name is Prem and I'm from Chennai, India. I'm a Physicist plus Chemical Engineer. Weird combination yes, but physics and math rule! Mathematical modeling & Simulation is one of my major areas of expertise and I lived and worked in EU for more than 14 years as a Research Manager and Management Consultant specializing in Analytics solutions before coming back to Chennai. At the moment, I'm working remotely for a specialized European fintech firm.</p>
			<p style='text-align: justify;'> I'm also available for hire as a freelance researcher (qualitative & quantitative), strategy consultant and analytics advisor. Do contact me at my email if you're interested in working with me. In addition to English, I also speak good Japanese, Dutch, Italian and fluent German. Feel free to communicate in any of the aforementioned languages. Check out my CV page for some specifics. Also see my other blogs for more information.</p>
